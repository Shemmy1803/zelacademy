Oluwatisemilogo Odunowo known as "Shemmy" in school is a Lethbridge College resident in her Freshman year of the CIT program.
<br>
She is eighteen years old and came from Calgary where she lived with her parents before she came to take Computer Science in the Lethbridge College.
<br>
Before she went into Computer science, Shemmy's dream had always been Physiotherapy. She loved Biology in High School and hoped to be a Physiotherapist like her Grandpa oneday.
<br>
When Shemmy got to Canada, she thought she would study Physiotherapy in College or University,but she needed highschool grades to go into Physiotherapy. 
Unfortunately, she wasn't ready to face Physics and Chemistry because of the struggles she had with them from secondary school in Nigeria, where she is originally from.
<br>
Her second option was Dentistry, but that didn't really make any difference as Physiotherapy and Dentistry had similar requirements.
<br>
At this point, Shemmy had no choice but to look into another career. She tried searching online and pondered with her parents. 
Shemmy was encouraged to go for a career that she's interested in. Making a choice was really hard for her. Her only interest was Medicine and Computer as a second option,
but she didn't have High school grades for Medicine, and she was afraid of failing Computer science.
<br>
Her Mom suggested Nursing, she wasn't interested. Her Dad, an IT person, and asked if she would like to try IT. She was so skeptical and couldn't come up with something.
<br>
Eventually, she made up her mind and decided to go into IT eventhough Computer studies was her least favourite course in Highschool. 
<br>
Shemmy began to prepare for Computer science and look for a School that will suit her. SAIT was her first option.
She had enough grades and Percentage to get into IT but due to some "technical difficulties", Shemmy had to look for another choice of College. 
<br>
After searching and searching, Lethbridge College became the final option, and here she is; A bonafide student of Lethbridge College!
